<h3>What is Spam?</h3> 
<p>In the context of electronic messaging, spam refers to any unsolicited, bulk or indiscriminate messages, typically sent for a commercial purpose. 3DePlans.com has a zero-tolerance spam policy.</p>

<h3>Automated spam filtering</h3> 

<p>3DePlans.com messaging systems automatically scan all incoming email (and other) messages, and filter-out messages that appear to be spam.</p>

<h3>Problems with spam filtering</h3>

<p>No message filtering system is 100% accurate, and from time to time legitimate messages will be filtered-out by 3DePlans.com systems.</p>

<p>If you believe this has happened to a message you have sent, please advise 3DePlans.com by another means.</p>

<p>You can reduce the risk of a message being caught by the spam filters by sending the message in plain text (i.e. no HTML), removing any attachments, and ensuring that your messages are scanned for malware before dispatch.</p>
