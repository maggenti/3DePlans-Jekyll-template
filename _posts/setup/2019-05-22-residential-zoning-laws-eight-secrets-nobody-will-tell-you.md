  Residential Zoning Laws: Let's talk about residential zoning, and why this is so important. We will also define what zoning is for those who do not know.

## <span style="color: #8a6407;">Residential Zoning:  </span>

### Ok so their is <span style="color: #8a6407;">R-1</span>, <span style="color: #8a6407;">R-2</span>, <span style="color: #8a6407;">R-3</span> zoning, what is that?  We need to start from the beginning.

  1. <span style="color: #8a6407;"><strong>R-1</strong></span> is reserved for hotels and transient boarding houses; These are occupants that are transient and sleeping in their rooms for less than 30 days. The requirements are assuming that the occupants are not familiar with their surroundings.
  2. <span style="color: #8a6407;"><strong>R-2</strong></span> is reserved for apartments, dormitories and long-term residential boarding houses. Occupants are more permanent and sleeping for more than 30 days. We are not concerned with these.
  3. <span style="color: #8a6407;"><strong>R-3</strong></span> is reserved for occupants that are permanent, like homes, houses, what we want to hear about. Ya, and yes I know we do tend to move every seven years or so. But, <span style="color: #8a6407;"><strong>R-3</strong></span> occupancy is considered permanent and is defined as being those not meeting the criteria for <span style="color: #8a6407;"><strong>R1</strong></span> or <span style="color: #8a6407;"><strong>R-2</strong></span>. This is primarily single family residences and duplexes. Ok it also covers daycare facilities for five or fewer people using the facility for less than 24 hours. Again not what we are covering. But they do also fall into this occupancy group.

There is a lot of territory to cover so we best get to it directly, so let&#8217;s just jump right in. Oh, ya, one more item, I may say lot, or property, or parcel, they really are one in the same thing so please do not let me know I said parcel and ment lot etc. I know I did ok. They tend to be indifferent sizes; however I am trying to refer to the land which you will build your dream home, or remodel, or your flipper property etc. Out of all the issues you can have one of the most important thing to get right is your setbacks.

### <span style="color: #8a6407;">The 4 Most Important Residential Zoning Laws:</span>

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;"><span style="color: #8a6407;">#1</span> A setback is the distance between your property line and the foundation of your project.</span>**

Even if you have not purchase your parcel yet, if you know the general area in which you are going to build get the setbacks. The setback is just that, you must set back a certain distance from the property line before you can build. In all cases you will want to be more than three feet otherwise you run into some really super nasty fire codes.

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;"><span style="color: #8a6407;">#2</span> They are different everywhere.</span>**

They can even be different for the first story and second story of your home. They can even be different on the same street or even house to house. I know it sounds incredibly strange; however now you know and you must get correct ones for where you are going to build.

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;"><span style="color: #8a6407;">#3</span> The lot coverage maximums and their unique formula.</span>**

One of the hardest ever has to be the city of Davis in California. You may or may not have heard of Davis, which has one of the most unique formulas I have worked with.  Yes it is very possible that they will not let you build it. Even if the setbacks are just fine. It is the way you have it designed and laid out, it is all wrong in their mind? It is as simple as that to them. I know you are saying what?

It could all blow up on you and cost a lot of money to fix (at least in time). I know, you think I am making a mountain out of a molehill. No, I have done this myself and even after 10+ years of doing this.  That is when KaBoom occurs, because I was too confident. I am trying to save you the pain and suffering that I have had to endure in the past.

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;"><span style="color: #8a6407;">#4</span> If you have the wrong setbacks and something actually gets built wrong it will have to be removed, and or moved.</span>**

Yep, and if that something is in concrete or the actual foundation KaBoom! There goes the budget, maybe even a lawsuit and it could be a huge deal. So make sure to get this part absolute perfect, actually make sure everything is perfect and I mean everything all the way from start to finish!

Setbacks are easy to get (for the most part) there are some weird items such as accessory buildings that have strange requirements like if you build on Tuesday it is 5’ but on Wednesday it is 6’ you know like a &#8220;fizzbin&#8221; (just kidding, but look that up just for fun) The truth is it really can get extremely complex, so get it right the first time.

### <span style="color: #8a6407;">These Next 4 Residential Zoning Laws Are Critical:</span>

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;"><span style="color: #8a6407;">#5</span> GET IT IN WRITING!</span>**

Another thing, I always suggest you purchase a copy of the city or county general plan. Come up with a list of questions and then go get the answers from your local planning department. Look, on one occasion I had three different planners arguing about a silly little garage setback for over two hours at the counter.  This is exactly why I recommend that you do several dry runs; each planner has a different opinion of what the local codes and ordinance say. So as you can see it can be a bit trying at times, just keep your cool and make sure to get the correct answers.  And do not be afraid to ask them to put in into writing, I would have them sign your drawing, under where you write:

&#8220;I approve these setbacks and this layout: x\___\___\___\___\___\___\____&#8221; (Have them sign this)  
&#8220;Name: x \___\___\___\___\___\___\____&#8221; (Have then print their name)  
Date: x\___\___\___\___\___\___\____&#8221; (Have them DATE IT &#8211; CRITICAL!)

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;"><span style="color: #8a6407;">#6</span> Don’t be afraid to stand your ground.</span>**

You may be right.  I have seen it all and it never hurts to try (be nice though).

_“Interpretation of the local building code, local ordinance, and any municipal codes is extremely difficult. However it is always very important to get it right.”_

This stuff may seem very simple and most of the time it really is. But if you do not follow the rules they can kill your design and or your dreams. I always recommend that you do a dry run past planning on paper and see if you can get them to approve it in writing every single time.

You see then when you come back with your design it is harder for them say well this simply won&#8217;t work. Because you did your homework! I am not talking about trying to beat the system, I am saying that there is always more than one way to look at some part of the code and it is always best to do a pre-luminary run through.

Even after you do the floor plan design (basic one) and put it on your plot plan (I will talk about that in great detail later) then run that past them. You can keep doing this all the way through the entire design, if need be and sometimes it really is. It just depends on your building department and planning department. You will know how to deal with them after a few projects. Some towns and or cities really are picky and you need to make sure all the way through that you are on the right track.

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;">#7 I had an approval in writing and when I came back that <em>person was gone!</em></span>**

I was no longer in charge, and my ticket, well I was pushing the limits so it was no longer valid anymore. So I had to change the plan, can you believe it? Yes it happens, even to pro&#8217;s. 

#### **<span style="color: #d0a53e;"><span style="color: #8a6407;">#8</span> This can even happen after you are already building the house.</span>**

I have seen plans approved on the second floor a window looking into a neighbor’s yard.  Yes it was in the CCNR’s (Community Covenants Neighborhood Restrictions, more on that later) but the window was at a 45 degree so it technically did not point into his yard. All you could see was his back fence, big whoop. But he got his way and that window was well lets just say upgraded to a stained glass window (there is always a way to fix things). Sometimes you need to be creative.
