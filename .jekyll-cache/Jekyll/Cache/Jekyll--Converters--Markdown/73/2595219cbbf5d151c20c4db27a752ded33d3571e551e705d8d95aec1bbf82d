<h2 id="who-is-3deplans-a-personal-word-from-the-ceo">WHO IS 3DEPLANS: A Personal Word From The CEO</h2>

<p>My Dad always told me to do it right or don’t do it at all.  Sound familiar, or how about my Dads Dad (my Grandfather) told me; you can be anything you want, just don’t be another one, stand out, be the best at it! So I say to you; if it is worth doing, it is worth doing it right.</p>

<p>To expand on this let me tell you a story that will explain the importance of this in another way:  Back in 1780 Before Christ (my mentor)  just a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>There lived a great leader.  His name was Hammurabi. Hammurabi created what he called the “Hammurabi’s Code of Laws”.  I know most of us would not have survived back then if you think today is bad these were very harsh times.</p>

<p>Back then they were not as tolerant of mistakes and very strict, as compared to today. Let me read just two of Hammurabi’s Code of Laws to you so you may better understand what I am trying to explain here is a couple of quotes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“If a builder build a house for some one, and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death!”</li>
  <li>“If it kills the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death!”</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you imagine if that were true today?</p>

<p>Most of today’s building codes and local rules and ordinances are for your safety. At times they may seem silly or even just plum crazy at times, but they are there to save lives which could be your own. They are there to keep you safe, warm and cozy.</p>

<p>So if the code says you need to do something that you do not agree with, just suck it up and DO IT!Just think back to Hammurabi’s Code of Laws and just do it the way the code says even if it sounds crazy to you. It just might save someone you love! And that should be everyone right?, “A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so also you must love one another.” By Jesus Christ – John 13:34</p>

<p>Try to remember that these building codes have been around a very long time.  Their creators have seen just about every possible scenario.  These are things that neither one of us have. Believe me I know they may seem at times to be making your life a living hell, but that is not there intent at all. They are trying their best to save you lots of pain in the long run.</p>
